The Flappy Bird Game project is a recreation of the popular mobile game, developed using Java Swing and AWT libraries. The player controls a bird that continuously moves forward, and the goal is to navigate it through randomly generated pipes without colliding with them.

This project demonstrates 2D game development concepts such as rendering graphics, handling user input, collision detection, animations, and event-driven programming.

âœ¨ Features

Bird movement controlled with the Spacebar.
Gravity effect and upward velocity on jump.
Randomly generated top and bottom pipes with gaps.
Scoring system that increases as the bird psses pipes.
Game Over screen with restart functionality.
Smooth frame updates using Java Timer.

ðŸ“Œ Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned and practiced:
Building GUI applications with Java Swing.
Implementing game loops and frame rendering.
Designing and managing 2D game objects (bird, pipes, background).
Implementing collision detection and game state management.
Enhancing problem-solving and debugging skills in Java.
